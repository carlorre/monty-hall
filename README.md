# Monty Hall Paradox Simulator

## Background

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle where a player chooses
one of three doors to potentially win a car. After the player's initial
choice, the host reveals one of the remaining doors that does not contain
the car. The player is then given the option to switch their choice to
the other unopened door. Surprisingly, switching doors increases the
chances of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3.

## Description

The purpose of this application is to prove the Monty Hall Paradox by
simulating a chosen number of games and whether or not to change the
original door choice and then displaying the results.

## Features

- Input field to specify the number of simulations
